### :octocat: Intent
>**State** is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

### :octocat: Structure

### :octocat: Applicability 
- *Single Responsibility* Principle. Organize the code related to particular states into separate classes.
- *Open/Closed* Principle. Introduce new states without changing existing state classes or the context.
- Simplify the code of the context by eliminating bulky state machine conditionals.

### :octocat: Related Patterns
- State can be considered as an extension of [Strategy](https://github.com/armleung/udemy-design-pattern/tree/master/Stragegy). Both patterns are based on composition: they change the behavior of the context by delegating some work to helper objects. Strategy makes these objects completely independent and unaware of each other. However, State doesnâ€™t restrict dependencies between concrete states, letting them alter the state of the context at will.
